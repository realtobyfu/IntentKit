   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

3. **Make Changes**: Make your changes and commit them
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add your meaningful commit message"
   ```

4. **Run Tests**: Ensure all tests pass
   ```bash
   swift test
   ```

5. **Run Benchmarks**: Check performance impact
   ```bash
   swift test --filter Benchmark
   ```

6. **Push & PR**: Push your branch and create a pull request
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Swift Style Guide

* Follow [Swift API Design Guidelines](https://swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/)
* Use 4 spaces for indentation (not tabs)
* Keep lines under 120 characters when possible
* Use meaningful variable and function names
* Add documentation comments for all public APIs

### Code Organization

```
IntentKit/
â”œâ”€â”€ Sources/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IntentKitCore/       # Core framework code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IntentKitCodeGen/    # Code generation module
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ IntentKitCLI/        # Command-line tool
â”œâ”€â”€ Tests/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IntentKitCoreTests/  # Unit tests
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ IntentKitCodeGenTests/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ IntentKitBenchmarks/ # Performance tests
â””â”€â”€ Examples/                # Example usage
```

### Documentation

* Use Swift documentation comments for all public APIs:
  ```swift
  /// Brief description of the function.
  /// - Parameters:
  ///   - parameter1: Description of parameter1
  ///   - parameter2: Description of parameter2
  /// - Returns: Description of return value
  /// - Throws: Description of errors that can be thrown
  public func myFunction(parameter1: String, parameter2: Int) throws -> Bool
  ```

* Update README.md if you change user-facing functionality
* Add entries to CHANGELOG.md for notable changes

### Testing

* Write unit tests for all new functionality
* Ensure test coverage remains above 95%
* Include both positive and negative test cases
* Add performance tests for critical paths
* Test names should clearly describe what they test:
  ```swift
  func testParameterExtractionWithValidatorSucceeds()
  func testBatchDonationFailsWithInvalidIntents()
  ```

## Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

Examples:
```
Add async parameter resolution support

- Implement AsyncParameterResolver
- Add tests for async resolution
- Update documentation

Fixes #123
```

## Release Process

1. Update version numbers in relevant files
2. Update CHANGELOG.md with release notes
3. Create a git tag for the release
4. GitHub Actions will automatically run tests and create release
